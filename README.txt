PII_Scanner is a small programm to scan text file and remplace the persons names, email adresses and phone numbers in it by ***.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

For this programm to work you need Python 3.5 and the Nltk library.

The first time you run it, the programm may ask for modules like 'punkt', 'averaged_perceptron_tagger', 'maxent_ne_chunker' or 'words'. In these cases, add 'nltk.download(modulename)' in the import lines

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT PII_Scanner DOES:

- replace all proper nouns in a text file (function replace_proper_names in PII_Scanner.py)
or:
- replace persons names in a text file with between 80% and 90% of efficiency (replace_person_names_version2 in PII_Scanner.py)
or:
- replace persons names (80-90% efficency) and email adresses in a text file (replace_person_mail_names in PII_Scanner.py)


WHAT PII_Scanner WILL DO (eventually):

- replace phone numbers
- have a better replacement efficiency for persons names
- replace persons names written without uppercase first letter
- replace adresses
- include carriage returns

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALGORITHM SUMMARY:

The text file is read.
The resulting string is cut into words and punctuation tokens
The tokens are tagged by Named Entity Recognition packages from nltk to identify proper names/persons/email/... in the text
The tokens are written one by one in a text file, the one having the targeted tag being replace by ***.
