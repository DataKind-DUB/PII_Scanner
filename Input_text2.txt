During the Ganeshotsav festival in India, while most people keep complaining about the wastage of food and excessive
festivities, some people have gone ahead and done something different to make the festival more meaningful./Users/datakind/Documents/pii_scanner/PII_Scanner/POS Tagging.py
Taking the lead is one family from Aundh, which has asked its guests visiting their home to take darshan of the idol 
with offerings as books, pencils, pens or any stationery rather than eatables or flower garlands. The initiative has 
been taken by Jigesh and Priya Kulkarni, residents of C.V.T. Society who started the idea by messaging their friends and 
relatives a few days ago.
"Every festival we have been trying to reduce the unnecessary fanfare instead do something meaningful for society as we think 
we owe to our future generations to set an example. This year, it was my husband and son Arjun (arjun.kulkarni@gmail.com)
who suggested this idea to the family. It's the first year so we don't know how much we would collect. But whatever we collect 
at the end of festival, we would contribute from our end and give it to the students in orphanage",says Mrs.Kulkarni.
